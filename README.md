# FACE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM:
#### ➢Attendance in a classroom is important.  So, teachers need to record the students attending classes and those missing them.
#### ➢But manually doing so consumes a lot of valuable learning time.
#### ➢Here is a solution for that, a software that takes care of attendance with no effort from the teacher.
#### ➢It looks for students' preloaded faces from that particular class.
#### ➢If it detects the face of a student, that student is marked present for that class. 
#### ➢The software can recognize any number of faces at the same time.
