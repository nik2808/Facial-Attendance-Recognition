FACE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM:
➢Attendance in a classroom is important.  So, teachers need to record the students attending classes and those missing them.
➢But manually doing so consumes a lot of valuable learning time.
➢Here is a solution for that, a software that takes care of attendance with no effor from the teacher.
➢It looks for students' preloaded faces from that particular class.
➢If it detects the face of a student, that student is marked present for that class. 
➢The software can recognize any number of faces at the same time.
